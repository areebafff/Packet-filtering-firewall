# Packet-filtering-firewall

A packet filtering firewall is a type of network security system that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined rules. The firewall examines the packets of data as they travel through the network and compares them to the rules defined in its filtering policies. If a packet matches a rule, it is allowed to pass through the firewall. If it does not match any rules, it is blocked or dropped.

# 1) use wireshark to capture packets and save them in text file 
# 2) name those files tcp.txt and udp.txt
